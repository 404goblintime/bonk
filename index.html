        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Our Vision for Legacy Magnet Academy:

            To be the premier 6-12 school in the region for students who wish to pursue their passion for technology, innovation, design and entrepreneurship, in preparation for college, career and future endeavors, facilitated in the context of collaboration, personalization, relevance and partnerships.

            Our Guiding Principles:

            Collaboration: Students, teachers and other stakeholders spend time together in joint intellectual efforts, exercising choice and making decisions in all elements of school life. Teachers plan and learn together utilizing an interdisciplinary approach enhanced by frequent and ongoing professional development with a focus and emphasis on Project Based and Problem Based Learning (PBL).

            Personalization: A diverse learning community, built on powerful relationships, ensures that the emotional and intellectual needs of students are met. Goal setting and self-reflection are a key component of each student's instructional program.

            Relevance: Teachers and students engage in authentic, in-depth learning experiences in the context of real-world problem solving through PBL. Learning occurs in a coherent manner through challenging inquiry and project-based curriculum, providing students access to content that they both understand the use for as well as find personal connection to.

            Partnerships: Learning takes place inside the school and out, in cooperation with community, business, industry experts and higher education partners. Partnerships provide human talent, facilities, technology and other resources necessary to prepare students for the ever-changing world of work and education.</p>

        <h1>Dress Code</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
       Legacy Magnet Academy requests that all students dress for success. Coming to school dressed for success helps promote pride and professionalism and reminds us all that our primary focus is on academics and a productive school experience. The quality of work students produce at school can be affected by their personal appearance. Students should dress with reasonable standards of cleanliness and modesty. Clothing and hairstyles are to be worn that will not draw the undue attention of peers or be distracting to class instruction. 

In order to provide a safe learning environment free from major distractions, school wide dress code guidelines have been developed. The following specific dress code guidelines will be expected and enforced:

Covered midriffs (stomachs), cleavage, and backs 

Completely covered undergarments 

Clothing free from offensive, gang related, or otherwise inappropriate images, messages, or advertisements related but not limited to alcohol, tobacco and/or drugs 

Tops with some type of sleeve or strap 

No excessively short shorts or miniskirts 

Parents may call the school at any time for clarification prior to purchase of school attire. If students attend school dressed inappropriately, different attire can be provided. Repeat violations may result in disciplinary action. Parent support in encouraging students to dress appropriately is paramount.
